# Riiid AIEd Challenge 2020

Riiid Labs, an AI solutions provider delivering creative disruption 
to the education market, empowers global education players to rethink 
traditional ways of learning leveraging AI. With a strong belief in 
equal opportunity in education, Riiid launched an AI tutor based on 
deep-learning algorithms in 2017 that attracted more than one million 
South Korean students. This year, the company released EdNet, the world’s 
largest open database for AI education containing more than 100 million 
student interactions.

In this competition, your challenge is to create algorithms for 
"Knowledge Tracing," the modeling of student knowledge over time. 
The goal is to accurately predict how students will perform on future 
interactions. You will pair your machine learning skills using Riiid’s 
EdNet data.

Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted 
probability and the observed target.
